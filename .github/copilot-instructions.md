## Project Context
Tamatar is a developer progress tracking application built with TanStack Start, allowing developers to log daily progress, manage projects, track GitHub activity, and discover learning resources.

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: TanStack Start with TanStack Router and TanStack Query
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Motion (formerly Framer Motion)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **GraphQL**: graphql-request with gql.tada for type-safe queries
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Package Manager**: Bun
- **Runtime**: Node.js

### Key Architecture Decisions
- TypeScript strict mode for all files
- Dark mode first design approach
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component composition over inheritance
- Server state (TanStack Query) + Client state (Zustand) + Local state (React useState)

## Code Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns
- Use Zod schemas for all form validation and API data validation
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use TanStack Query for all server state management
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use Zustand for client-side state that needs to persist across route changes

## Styling Guidelines
- Follow the "dark mode first" design approach â€” design for dark mode, then adapt for light
- Use semantic color variables defined in `src/styles.css` (OKLCH color space)
- Use the `cn()` utility from `src/lib/utils.ts` for combining class names
- Use `src/lib/style-utils.ts` for advanced styling patterns
- Keep component-specific styles in `src/styles/components.css`
- Define animations in `src/styles/animations.css`
- Follow spacing and typography guidelines from the style guide
- Ensure all components meet WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Reference the comprehensive [Style Guide](../docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md) for detailed guidance

## Component Guidelines
- All form components should use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Use shadcn/ui components as the foundation for all UI elements
- Implement proper loading and error states for all async operations
- Use Motion for smooth transitions and animations with duration variables
- Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Use the StatusBadge component for consistent status indicators
- Implement ThemeToggle for theme switching functionality

## Development Methodology
Follow a focused, single-item development approach:

1. **Focus on One Item**: Work on only one module, route, component, or server function at a time
2. **Complete Implementation**: Fully implement the feature with proper typing, validation, and error handling
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality works as expected with proper testing
4. **Code Review & Refactoring**: 
   - Compare with existing code patterns
   - Identify and eliminate repetitive code
   - Extract reusable utilities or components
   - Ensure consistency with architecture patterns
5. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant files (README, docs, architecture guides)
6. **Commit & Move Forward**: Only then proceed to the next feature

This approach prevents context switching, ensures quality, promotes code reusability, and keeps documentation current.

## State Management
- Use TanStack Query for server state (API data, caching, synchronization)
- Use Zustand for client state that persists across routes (user preferences, UI state)
- Keep local component state minimal and focused on UI interactions only

## API Design
- Use GraphQL with gql.tada for type-safe queries and mutations
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Use optimistic updates where appropriate
- Cache data effectively with TanStack Query

## Error Handling
- Use centralized error codes from `src/types/error-codes.ts`
- Implement error boundaries for route-level error handling
- Use consistent error response pattern with `ErrorResponse` interface
- Provide user-friendly error messages based on error codes
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Implement graceful degradation for failed API calls

## GitHub Integration Requirements
- OAuth authentication with GitHub
- Repository browsing and selection
- Commit history and diff viewing
- Issue and PR tracking
- Webhook support for real-time updates

## Authentication & Security
- Implement secure authentication flow
- Store tokens securely
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Use HTTPS for all API communications

## Performance Considerations
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize bundle size with proper imports
- Use React.memo and useMemo where appropriate
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Cache frequently accessed data

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for user flows
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Mock GraphQL responses for consistent testing

## Deployment
- Build optimized production bundles
- Environment-specific configurations
- Proper error logging and monitoring
- Performance tracking and analytics

- **Security & Compliance**: SOC 2, GDPR compliance, and enterprise security
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling infrastructure and database sharding

When implementing features, always consider the user experience, performance implications, and maintainability of the code. Focus on creating a polished, professional application that developers will enjoy using to track their progress.
